# Marketo_Bulk_API_To_Get_All_Lead_Activities

! THIS SCRIPT REQURIES THE MARKETO PYTHON REST API LIBRARY ! 
-> https://pypi.org/project/marketorestpython/

A small script that was created to automate getting Marketo lead activities using python that respects Marketo's 30 day break down of extracts.


A Large Section of the Scrip is straight up from https://www.demandgen.com/how-to-extract-leads-from-marketo-using-python/


However I just added the 30 day break up so it becomes easier to just put big date ranges in and the script divides the date ranges to different csvs.
